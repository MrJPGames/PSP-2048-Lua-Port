PSP 2048 Lua port
=================

A port of the popular game 2048 to the PSP made with Lua. Uses LPP (I think) as the luaplayer.
It Has custom ICON0 and PIC1 in XMB.
Works with both <b>OFW</b> and <b>CFW</b> PSP's (<b>All</b> PSP models)


Instalation:
1. Download all files as a zip
2. Create a folder called 2048 in /PSP/GAME/ on your PSP's MemoryCard
3. Copy all files to the 2048 folder you created
4. Profit?!

Bugs:
The sliding works diffrent from original game. As I do not work on this project any more, feel free to fix it. Just add a pull when done and I will put it in master.
